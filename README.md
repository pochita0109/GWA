HIGHEST GWA FINDER

Write a Python program that read a file containing the name of 20 students together with their GWA. The program will outputs the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA).

Process:
1. You need to create a file first where you will input there the names of students and their corresponding GWAs.
2. Read the contents of the txt file that you have created by printing it.
3. Declare variables for the name of the student with highest GWA and the GWA limit.
4. After creating variables, split the contents of your txt file by using split method.
5. Convert the GWA of students to float.
6. Create a condition wherein if the GWA is the highest among all of the students in txt file, showcase the name and its GWA.
7. Print the results.

If you run the program, it will show the student with highest GWA by printing the name and his/her GWA.
